# Flutter Earth - Advanced GEE Downloader

A powerful Python application for downloading and processing satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine. This application provides a modern Qt-based GUI interface for selecting areas of interest, managing satellite data downloads, and processing imagery.

## Features

- Modern Qt-based GUI interface
- Support for multiple satellite data sources (Landsat, Sentinel-2, ERA5)
- Advanced cloud masking and image processing
- Vector data support (Shapefiles, GeoJSON)
- Interactive map selection
- Multi-threaded downloads
- Progress tracking and logging
- Theme customization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Authenticate with Google Earth Engine:
```bash
earthengine authenticate
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python flutter_earth_6-19.py
```

2. Select your area of interest using one of the following methods:
   - Draw on the interactive map
   - Import a shapefile
   - Enter coordinates manually

3. Choose your satellite data source and time range

4. Configure processing options:
   - Cloud masking
   - Resolution
   - Bands to download
   - Output format

5. Start the download process

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in a JSON file. You can modify the following settings:
- Default output directory
- Tile size and overlap
- UI theme
- Processing parameters

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter authentication issues:
   - Ensure you've run `earthengine authenticate`
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your Google Earth Engine account is active

2. For performance issues:
   - Reduce the size of your area of interest
   - Increase tile size
   - Check available disk space
