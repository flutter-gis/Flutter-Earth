# Flutter Earth - QML Edition

A powerful, user-friendly tool for downloading and processing satellite imagery using the Google Earth Engine, now with a modern QML-based interface.

## Features

-   **Modern QML Interface**: A sleek and responsive user interface built with Qt for a better user experience.
-   **Modular Backend**: The application is now structured as a professional Python package for better maintainability and scalability.
-   **Theming Support**: Switch between 'Dark', 'Light', and 'Sanofi' themes.
-   **Advanced Downloading**: Download satellite imagery from multiple sensors like Landsat and Sentinel-2.
-   **On-the-fly Processing**: Includes cloud masking and other pre-processing capabilities.
-   **Robust Configuration**: A clear, class-based configuration system manages all settings.
-   **Comprehensive Satellite Info**: Browse detailed information about available satellites.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   A Google Earth Engine account with API access enabled.
-   Required Python packages (see `flutter_earth_pkg/requirements.txt`).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Flutter-Earth
```

### 2. Install required packages

The dependencies are now managed within the `flutter_earth_pkg`.

```bash
pip install -r flutter_earth_pkg/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Earth Engine Authentication

The application now primarily uses a **service account** for authentication with Google Earth Engine. You will need to:
1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project** and enable the Earth Engine API.
2.  **Create a Service Account** within your project and grant it the "Earth Engine Resource Viewer" or similar permissions.
3.  **Download the JSON key file** for your service account.

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, please refer to `EARTH_ENGINE_SETUP.md`.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of recent changes, bug fixes, and new features. The changelog is automatically updated with each major release and important fix.

### Recent Major Changes
- Scroll wheel now works in the Download page (QML layout fix)
- Authentication dialog now uses the key file path and prevents duplicate key files
- Status bar color now updates for online/offline status
- Download page layout and usability improved
- Error handling and user feedback improved throughout the app

## Configuration

The application uses a configuration file (`flutter_earth_config.json`) that is automatically created in the root directory on first run. You can modify settings such as:

-   Default output directory
-   UI Theme (`Default (Dark)`, `Light`, `Sanofi`)
-   Tile size for downloads
-   Maximum cloud cover percentage
-   Default sensor priority

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored into a more robust and modular structure:

```

## Development

### Adding New Sensors

1.  Add the sensor's metadata to the `SATELLITE_DETAILS` dictionary in `flutter_earth_pkg/flutter_earth/config.py`.
2.  If the new sensor requires unique processing steps, implement them in `flutter_earth_pkg/flutter_earth/processing.py`.
3.  The satellite information view will automatically pick up the new sensor data.

### Modifying the UI

The user interface is defined in the `.qml` files located in `flutter_earth_pkg/flutter_earth/qml/`. You can edit these files to change the UI layout and behavior. The Python backend is exposed to QML via the `AppBackend` class in `flutter_earth_pkg/flutter_earth/gui.py`.

## Support

For issues and questions:
1.  Ensure your Earth Engine service account is correctly set up as per `EARTH_ENGINE_SETUP.md`.
2.  Check the application logs stored in the `logs/` directory.
3.  If you encounter a bug, please open an issue on the project's GitHub page.
